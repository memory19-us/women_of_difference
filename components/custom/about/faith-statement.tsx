//        We believe in one God, eternally existent in three Persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—Creator of heaven and earth, sovereign in power, holy in character, and faithful in all His ways.

// We believe in Jesus Christ, the Son of God, fully God and fully man—born of a virgin, lived a sinless life, died on the cross for the salvation of humanity, rose bodily from the dead, and is seated at the right hand of the Father. Salvation is found in Him alone through grace by faith, not by works.
// We believe that humanity was created in the image of God, yet fallen through sin and in need of redemption. Restoration comes through repentance, faith in Jesus Christ, and the renewing work of the Holy Spirit.
// We believe in the present work and power of the Holy Spirit, who convicts, regenerates, sanctifies, equips believers for godly living, and empowers the Church to fulfill the mission of Christ on the earth.
// We believe that transformation is both spiritual and practical—that faith must be lived out through obedience, discipline, stewardship, and love expressed in action. We are committed to holistic renewal that addresses the heart, the mind, and daily life.
// We believe in the Church, the body of Christ, called to worship God, disciple believers, care for the vulnerable, uphold justice, and advance the Kingdom of God with integrity and compassion.
// We believe in the resurrection of the dead, eternal life for those who are in Christ, and the ultimate fulfillment of God’s purposes according to His will and timing.
// This faith anchors our work, governs our leadership, and shapes our commitment to building lives, families, and communities that are rooted, ordered, and enduring
